  <p>This is important to note. This DOES NOT represent everything that I have learned. I decided to take out the most significant peices of information that are also the most different from one another. I have learned more but those would be a lot more difficult to explain or I could struggle to execute effectively, but this is a good summary of the key information I've absorbed.</p>
