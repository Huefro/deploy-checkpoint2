  <h3 class="return"><a href="index.html">Back to home</a></h3>
  <p>This is what I learned about forms and form submissions in HTML! This includes any kind of user input that you'd experience on a website.</p>
  <br>
  <form>
    <label for="user">Username:</label>
    <input type="text" name="username" id="user">
  </form>
  <form>
    <label for="pass">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" name="password" id="pass">
  </form>
  <p>This is a sample log in set up for a website where one would input a username and password. There's a method that will block the text going into the password box so no one can peek in at it. Feel free to type things in!</p>

  <form>
    <input type="radio" name="choice" id="yes" value="yes">
    <label for="yes">Yes</label>
    <input type="radio" name="choice" id="no" value="no">
    <label for="no">No</Yes></label>
  </form>
  <p>This is a sample of a form that asks for a yes or no answer. There's nothing to select for them, but it demonstrates what it could look like. </p>

  <form>
    <label for="extra" id="extra">Type something here:</label>
    <textarea name="extra" id="extra" rows="5" cols="30">
    </textarea>
  </form>

  <p>This allows users to freely comment and type without being limited to certain options or anything. Can be used for things like comments, feedback, or other things.</p>

  <form>
      <label for="meter">Scale:</label>
      <span>Bottom</span>
      <input type="range" id="meter" step="1" min="0" max="10">
      <span>Top</span>
  </form>

  <p>The last example I will show is a slider from the bottom to the top. This could be used for anything, such as review for a website for a volume slider.</p>
