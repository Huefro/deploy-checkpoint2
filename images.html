  <p>This is where I learned about how to add images to my HTML document and alter it using CSS!</p>

  <img class="image1" src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yG1o-QlGL.jpg"></img>
  <br>
  <p>We add pictures to HTML documents by taking the source image address. A lot of times this can be done by right clicking on most images on google and selecting "Copy Image Address." That's what I do and voila, there's our picture! Say hello to the TBH creature!"</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=uWEW1UjrhC_XfG9i" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>You can add videos too! This can be tricky to get the source file of, so what I do to make this work better is click on the share button of any YouTube video, and then click on "embed" where a big weird line of code shows up. It's one of the easiest ways that I know of to get the source code to any video.</p>

<p>Using the audio element, you can add audio files too. The problem is that it's more difficult to get the source code for various audio files, so just pretend i have one here.</p>
