  <p>There are many different ways to style your site to make it unique and yours; from font styles, text alignment,
    position and color, everything is in your hands.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="purp"> There are a few main styles of text, that being headers from 1-6, and paragraph text. Each of these
    can be styled in a CSS document to become truly yours. This element, for example, will be a slightly larger, bolded,
    purple text!</p>
